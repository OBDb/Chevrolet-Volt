    description: "The original Chevrolet Volt was a groundbreaking plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that GM called an 'extended-range electric vehicle' to emphasize its electric-first operation. Featuring a T-shaped 16 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and a complex propulsion system combining a 1.4L gasoline engine with electric motors, it offered approximately 35-40 miles of electric-only range before the gasoline engine engaged to extend total range to about 380 miles. The exterior featured aerodynamic styling to maximize efficiency, while the interior offered a futuristic design with a center-mounted digital display and touch-sensitive controls. Seating was limited to four passengers due to the battery placement. As one of the first mainstream plug-in hybrids on the market, the Volt won numerous awards including North American Car of the Year and represented GM's commitment to electrification technology. A minor update in 2013 increased electric range slightly and added new features."

    description: "The redesigned Volt featured more conventional exterior styling while maintaining good aerodynamics, addressing feedback that the original model looked too unusual. The propulsion system was thoroughly updated with a new 18.4 kWh lithium-ion battery and more efficient 1.5L range-extending engine, increasing electric range to approximately 53 miles and total range to over 400 miles. Energy efficiency improved with the new system requiring less gasoline when operating in extended-range mode. The interior adopted a more mainstream design with improved materials, conventional instruments, and seating for five passengers (though the middle rear position was compromised by the battery tunnel). Technology advanced with a standard 8-inch touchscreen featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and available driver assistance features including adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Despite being well-received and technologically advanced, declining sales amid shifting market preferences toward SUVs led to the Volt's discontinuation after the 2019 model year as GM redirected resources toward fully electric vehicles. The Volt's legacy includes pioneering PHEV technology that influenced subsequent electrified vehicles and advancing battery management systems that would benefit GM's later EV efforts."
